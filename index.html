        <p class="text">
          Adventure time in the real world can include a wide range of
          activities such as biking, surfing, and paragliding. These activities
          are often referred to as adventure sports or extreme sports and are
          designed to provide an exciting or unusual experience with an
          uncertain outcome1. Adventure sports gained popularity in the 1960s
          and have since become a popular way for people to challenge themselves
          and experience the thrill of pushing their limits1.

          Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over
          rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes1. This
          sport requires endurance, core and back strength, balance, bike
          handling skills, and self-reliance1. Mountain bikers ride on off-road
          trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, wider bike park
          trails, fire roads, and some advanced trails are designed with jumps,
          berms, and drop-offs to add excitement to the trail1. Mountain biking
          can generally be broken down into five distinct categories: cross
          country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as “Enduro”),
          downhill, and freeride

        <p class="text">
          Surfing is another popular adventure sport that involves riding waves
          on a surfboard. Surfers use their skills and knowledge of the ocean to
          catch waves and ride them towards the shore. Surfing can be done on
          various types of waves, from small beach breaks to large swells that
          produce massive waves
          <br /><br />
          Surfing is a water sport that involves riding breaking waves towards
          the shore, usually on a surfboard1. The sport has its roots in
          premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where it was practiced by both men and
          women from all social strata, from royalty to commoners1. In the early
          20th century, surfing underwent a revival and quickly spread to
          California and Australia1. Today, surfing is enjoyed on beaches with
          breakers throughout the world, and several international championships
          are held2. The goal of surfing is to maneuver on the unbroken face of
          the wave, preferably as far back towards the curl (“tube”) as
          possible2. In addition to surfboards, surfers can use belly-boards,
          kneeboards, or kayaks, or they can bodysurf using no board at all

          <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is an adventure sport that involves flying a paraglider,
          which is a lightweight, free-flying glider aircraft. Paragliders are
          launched by foot from a hill or mountain and can stay airborne for
          extended periods of time by using rising air currents. Paragliding
          offers a unique perspective of the world and allows pilots to soar
          like birds
          <br /><br />
          Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders, which are lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched
          glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure1. The pilot sits in a
          harness or in a cocoon-like ‘pod’ suspended below a fabric wing. The
          wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
          entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of
          the air flowing over the outside1. Paragliding can be traced back to
          the activities of French parachute inventor Pierre Lemoigne, who
          tow-launched his advanced round-parachute canopies in the 1950s. The
          ram-air-inflated cell structure originated in the early 1960s with the
          kite and parachute designs of Canadian-born American inventor Domina
          Jalbert2. Paragliders may be launched from flatland by towing, either
          with a winch or behind a vehicle. Takeoff and landing are on foot and
          usually occur on a hill or mountain
